# Houselytics

A machine learning data application built with Python and Streamlit to analyse housing data and predict house prices.

## Project Overview

Houselytics is a data-driven machine learning project designed to help a property owner understand housing prices in Ames, Iowa.

The project analyses historical housing data to identify key factors that influence sale prices and builds a regression model to predict house prices. The final outcome supports informed decision-making when pricing inherited and future properties.

## Business Understanding

### Client Background
Lydia Doe has inherited four houses located in Ames, Iowa, USA. While she has good knowledge of property prices in her home country, Belgium, she is unfamiliar with the housing market in Ames.

As a result, she risks either overpricing or underpricing the properties, which could lead to financial loss.

### Business Problem
The key business problem is the lack of reliable insight into how different house attributes influence sale prices in Ames, Iowa.

Lydia needs:
- A clear understanding of which features impact house prices
- A reliable way to predict house prices for her inherited properties
- Confidence in pricing future properties in the same area

### Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
- To analyse historical housing data and identify key price drivers
- To visualise relationships between house features and sale price
- To build a machine learning model that predicts house sale prices
- To provide a user-friendly interface for price prediction

### Stakeholders
- Primary stakeholder: Lydia Doe (property owner)
- Secondary stakeholders: Real estate advisors, potential buyers, data analysts

## Business Requirements

### Business Requirement 1: Data Analysis
The client wants to understand how different house attributes correlate with the sale price.
This will be addressed through data visualisation and statistical analysis.

### Business Requirement 2: Price Prediction
The client wants to predict the sale price of her inherited houses and any future properties in Ames, Iowa.
This will be addressed by building a supervised machine learning regression model.
